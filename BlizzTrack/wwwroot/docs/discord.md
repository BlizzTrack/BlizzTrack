# Usage Guide
The BlizzTrack Discord bot needs a little bot of setup to have it to start posting notifications whenever a new game version is available.  
In this guide, we will explain all the commands: what they do and how to use them.


## Commands
All commands are prefixed with `bt!`  
This is to ensure no other bots listen to the same commands.

### help
The help command will show an up-to-date list of all commands currently available on the bot.  
Additionally, this command can show syntax and other information about all commands.

#### Syntax
`bt!help`  
`bt!help <command>`
#### Example

### subscribe
This is the command used to setup the update feed for new game versions.  
This will post new messages in the current channel every time there's a new version available.

#### Syntax
`bt!subscribe <game>`
#### Example
![Example of bt!subscribe Overwatch](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387322146436808704/788441910489776179/unknown.png)


### unsubscribe
When you no longer want to receive feed updates for a game, you can unsubscribe using this command.  
This will only unsubscribe the *current* channel, not all other channels that have the same game subscription.

#### Syntax
`bt!unsubscribe <game>`
#### Example
![Example of bt!unsubscribe Overwatch](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387322146436808704/788442327723016202/unknown.png)


### search
Not everyone knows all the game names on the top of their head, and that's okay!
Searching for games is extremely easy with this simple command.

#### Syntax
`bt!search <game>`
#### Example
