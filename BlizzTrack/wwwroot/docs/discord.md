# Usage Guide
The BlizzTrack Discord bot needs a little bot of setup to have it to start posting notifications whenever a new game version is available.  
In this guide, we will explain all the commands: what they do and how to use them.


## Commands
All commands are prefixed with `bt!`  
This is to ensure no other bots listen to the same commands.

### help
The help command will show an updated list of all commands currently available on the bot.  
Additionally, this command can show syntax and other information about all commands.

##### Syntax
`bt!help` `bt!help <command>`
##### Example
